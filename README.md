# Colorizing-Black-White-Media
Colorizing Black and White Media using pretrained models

Colorizing Black and White Images:
This program uses  neural network such as CNN and Python Deep Learning Concepts to colorize the Black & White Images. Well the problem with colorizing Black & white images is that the variation of light value.
hence the above program works to colorize the image from the least light value to the maximum light value, ie. colorizing one black & white picture for 31 times. later the  program chooses the well colored image
from the 31 images as output image.

Colorizing Black and White Videos:
The project uses neural network such as CNN and Python Deep Learning Concepts to colorize the Black & White Video. The Process starts by feeding a Black & White Video through Python GUI, the program then breaks the
video into single frames, the above in the video of 30 seconds had 1045 frames. This frames are then colorized one by one once done the program joins the frames into a output video  .

# The things you need for colorizing black and white media:

you need the Pre-Trained models

dont worry i would provide the links to the pretrained models

link for colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt: "https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/tree/caffe/colorization/models"

link for pts_in_hull.npy: "https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/caffe/colorization/resources/pts_in_hull.npy"

link for colorization_release_v2.caffemodel: "https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/tree/caffe/colorization/models"

once after downloading place all the files in the same folder where the programs are present then create 3 new folders and rename them as follows

**1 bwimges**

**2 colorimages** 

**3 bwimges**

so you are all set to proceed with running the program

# Good Luck
